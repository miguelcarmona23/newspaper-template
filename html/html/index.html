        <div class="main-text multi-column">
            <p>PHOENIX – Experts around the country and in Arizona are raising alarms about the state's COVID-19 situation because cases and hospitalizations have increased for the past two weeks.</p>
            <p>The increase in cases can't solely be attributed to increased testing in Arizona, experts say.</p>            
            <p>Instead, it looks like the state is trending upward in a way that is concerning and could need another stay-at-home order to curb the spread.</p>

                    be. "I have not successfully picked out all photos of a truck on the first try. Something's gotta
                    change," says the designer, who has requested to remain anonymous.</p>

                    Codepens instead of mock conversations. This is a codepen showcase inception situation.</p>
